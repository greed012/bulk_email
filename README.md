<h2>Email Automation Web Application</h2>

This web application was built using the Django framework to allow users to easily send emails to multiple recipients. It was created after studying "Automate Boring Stuff with Python" as a way to apply some of the concepts from that course.
The application provides a simple interface where a user can input a list of email addresses, compose an email message, and schedule for that email to be sent out to all of those recipients multiple times if desired.

<h3>Features:</h3>

User-Friendly Interface: The application provides an intuitive and accessible user interface for seamless navigation and interaction.

<h3>How to Use:</h3>

Setup: Ensure Django is installed. Clone this repository to your local environment.
